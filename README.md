# Chess 2.0
Built on Java with the Swing frontend and Maven build tools, this implementation of chess plays like any other, with support for several configuration options and network play. The application was developed by a group at Chalmers University of Technology as part of the course DAT055.

## Install and launch 

Before proceeding make sure that a Java Virtual Machine is installed in the current environment. The application has been tested for Java versions between Java-10 and Java-16. 
 

The game is distributed as a ZIP achieve containing a JAR file and necessary resources. Unzip the archive somewhere using the tools provided by the operating system. Launching the game from the JAR may be done through the following command executed in the directory where the files were extracted: 

`>>> java –jar Chess-2.0.jar`

On some operation systems this may also be achieved through double clicking the file. The game will launch in a state ready for play, see User interface for information about how to navigate through the application. 

 

### Building from source 

The source code of the game may be cloned from the game’s GIT repository here3. Maven is the tool used to build the application. Most integrated development environments (IDEs) have built in support for Maven and may recognize the project as such. Follow the documentation provided by the IDE in use for how to build and run a Maven project.
